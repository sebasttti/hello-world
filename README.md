# hello-world
Hello to everyone, this is my frst GitHub repository. I came to the need (as all programmers do) of using a version control system because I had lots of changes to validate before they were put into the final file.

Perhaps I will not do it well at first, perhaps it could take me some time, but I promise I will develop this skill and share my work with many people in tha world. So be patient, I'm on duty!
